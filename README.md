## 🚀 Getting Started

### You can create a new project directly from this template using **NPX**:

### 1. Create a new project

- This will create a new folder called `my-app` with everything set up.

```console
$ npx @jc-jacobe/react-kit my-app
```

or

- If you want to install in the current folder, use:

```console
$ npx @jc-jacobe/react-kit .
```

### 2. Navigate into the project if you provide folder name.

```console
$ cd my-app
```

### 3. Start the development

```console
$ npm run dev
```

# ⚠️ Notes

- If you run the command in an existing folder (e.g., ./), make sure it’s empty before generating the project, otherwise you may get errors.
- Requires `Node.js v16+`.
